Description
The Crop Recommendation System is a machine learning-based application that provides recommendations for suitable crops based on various environmental and soil conditions. It aims to assist farmers and agricultural professionals in making informed decisions about crop selection, optimizing yields, and maximizing profitability.
Key Features
Input Data Collection: The system allows users to input relevant data such as soil parameters, climate information, and geographic location. Data Preprocessing: The input data is preprocessed to handle missing values, normalize or scale features, and transform categorical variables. Machine Learning Models: Various machine learning algorithms are employed, including decision trees, random forests, support vector machines (SVM), and gradient boosting techniques, to build predictive models.
echnologies Used
Python: Programming language used for model development, data preprocessing, and web application development. Scikit-learn: Machine learning library used for model training, evaluation, and prediction. Pandas: Data manipulation library used for data preprocessing and analysis. NumPy: Library for numerical computing used for handling arrays and mathematical operations. Flask: Web framework used for building the user interface and handling HTTP requests. HTML/CSS: Markup and styling languages used for designing the web interface. JavaScript: Scripting language used for client-side interactions and enhancing the user interface.
